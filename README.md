# Belly Button Biodiversity Visualization

I created an interactive dashboard to visualize information from the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet from the Public Science Lab at North Carolina State University.


## Technologies

Javascript:
1. d3 
2. Plotly 

HTML & CSS:
1. Bootstrap 

## Usage

- Run https://alicesartori.github.io/Javascript_dashboard/. 
- When accessing the page, select a sample ID number from the dropdown menu to see the visualizations of that specific sample belly-button bacteria.

## Development Process

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for a dashboard including:

1. Bar chart that displays the top 10 most populous bacteria from the sample.
2. Bubble chart that displays each bacteria present to represent how large the bacteria is in that sample.
3. A gauge that displays the frequency per week with which the participant washed their belly-button.
