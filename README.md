# Belly Button Biodiversity Visualization

I created an interactive dashboard to visualize information from the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet from the Public Science Lab at North Carolina State University.


## Technologies

Javascript:
1. d3 
2. Plotly 

HTML & CSS:
1. Bootstrap 

## Usage

- Run https://alicesartori.github.io/Javascript_dashboard/ to see the dashboard.
- When accessing the page, select a sample ID number from the dropdown menu to be able to see the visualizations of that specific sample belly-button bacteria.

## Development Process

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts for a dashboard including:

1. Bar chart that displays visually the top 10 most populous bacteria from the sample.
2. Bubble chart that displays each bacteria and how large that bacteria is in that sample.
3. A gauge chart that displays the frequency per week with which the participant washed their belly-button.
An image is below for reference for sample ID 940.
